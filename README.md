# John and Jacob Inc. Online Trading System Case Study 

John and Jacob, Inc, is a regional brokerage firm that has been successful over the last several years. Competition for customers is intense in this industry. The large national firms have been very deep pockets, with many services to offer clients. Severe competition also comes from discount and Internet trading companies. However, John and Jacob has been able to cultivate a substantial customer base from upper-middle-income clients in the northeast United States. To maintain a competitive edge with its customers, John and Jacob is in the process of modernizing its online trading system. The modernization will add new features to the existing system and expand the range of interfaces beyond desktop and laptop computers to include tablet computers and smartphones. The system will add Twitter messaging in addition to continued support for traditional e-mail.

Edward Finnigan, the project manager, is in the process of identifying all the groups of people who should be included in the development of the system requirements. He is not quite sure exactly who should be included. Here are the issues he is considering:

**Users.** The trading system will be used by customers and by staff in each of the company’s 30 trading offices. Obviously, the brokers who are going to use the system need to have input, but how should this be done? Edward also is not sure what approach would be best to ensure that the requirements are complete without requiring tremendous amounts of time from the stakeholders. Including all the offices would increase enthusiasm and support for the system, but it would increase the time required to compile the information. Furthermore, involving more brokers would bring divergent opinions that would have to be reconciled.


**Customers.** The trading system will also include trade order entry, investment analysis reports, trade confirmations, standard and customized reporting, and customer statements. Edward wonders how to involve John and Jacob customers in the development of system requirements. Edward is sensitive to this issue because many brokers have told him that their customers are unhappy with the current system, and customer complaints are sometimes posted to the public comments area of the current Web site. He would like to involve customers, but he does not know how.


**Other Stakeholders.** Edward knows he should involve other stakeholders to help define system requirements. He is not quite sure whom he should contact. Should he go to senior executives? Should he contact middle management? Should he include back-office functions like accounting and investing? He is not quite sure how to get organized or how to decide who should be involved.


1. What is the best method for Edward to involve the brokers (users) in the development of the
updated online trading system? Should he use a questionnaire? Should he interview the brokers
in each of the company’s 30 offices or would one or two brokers representing the entire group be
better? How can Edward ensure that the information about requirements is complete, yet not lose
too much time doing so?


2. Concerning customer input for the new system, how can Edward involve customers in the
process? How can he encourage them in participating? What methods can Edward use to ensure
that the customers he involves are representative of John and Jacob’s entire customer group?


3. As Edward considers what other stakeholders he should include, what are some criteria he should
use? Develop some guidelines to help him build a list of people to include.
