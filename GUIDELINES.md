# John and Jacob Inc. Online Trading System SAMPLE GUIDELINES

### **Involving brokers in the development of an updated online trading system is crucial for ensuring that the final product meets their needs. Here are a few strategies that Edward could consider:**

1. Mixed-Method Approach: Combining both qualitative and quantitative methods may yield the most comprehensive insights. Edward could start with a questionnaire to gather broad feedback from a larger group of brokers. This would allow him to identify common themes and prioritize key features.

2. Focus Groups: After analyzing the questionnaire responses, Edward could organize focus groups with a representative sample of brokers from different offices. This way, he can dive deeper into specific requirements and get more nuanced feedback.

3. Interviews: For the most critical features or areas of concern, conducting in-depth interviews with a few key brokers—perhaps those who have been with the company the longest or have direct experience with the current system—could provide valuable insights.

4. Workshops: Hosting collaborative workshops with representatives from various offices can generate creative ideas and foster a sense of ownership among the brokers. This could be a great way to brainstorm and prioritize features together.

5. Prototyping and Feedback Cycles: After gathering initial requirements, developing a prototype or wireframe of the system and conducting usability testing with brokers can help ensure that their feedback is incorporated early and often.

6. Time Management: To keep the process efficient, Edward can set clear objectives for each method he uses, limit the discussion time in interviews and focus groups, and create specific questions or topics to cover.


By utilizing a combination of these methods, Edward can ensure that he gathers comprehensive and relevant information while still being respectful of everyone’s time. Engaging brokers throughout the process will help create a system that is user-friendly and meets their needs effectively.



### **Involving customers in the development of the new trading system is essential for creating a user-centric product. Here are some strategies Edward can utilize to effectively engage customers and ensure their input is representative:**

1. Surveys and Questionnaires:
- Edward can design surveys that target specific aspects of the trading system and distribute them through email or the company’s website. Offering incentives—like entry into a prize draw—can encourage customers to participate.

2. Customer Focus Groups:
- Organizing focus groups with diverse customers can provide qualitative insights. Edward should ensure that the groups include a mix of different customer segments (e.g., new customers, long-term users, high-volume traders, etc.) to get a balanced perspective.

3. Usability Testing:
- Inviting customers to test a prototype of the new system and provide feedback on their experience can yield invaluable insights. Edward can select customers who represent different user profiles to get a well-rounded view.

4. Customer Advisory Board:
- Establishing a small customer advisory board composed of several customers from various segments can facilitate ongoing feedback and discussions throughout the development process.

5. Engagement Through Social Media and Forums:
- Edward can utilize social media platforms or online forums to invite customers to share their thoughts and suggestions. Hosting Q&A sessions or polls can also boost engagement.

6. Incentives for Participation:
- To encourage participation, Edward could offer rewards such as discounts, free trials of new features, or exclusive access to the new system for customers who contribute their feedback.

7. Demographic Representation:
- To ensure customer input is representative, Edward should analyze the existing customer base and segment it by key demographics (age, trading frequency, geographical location, etc.). He can then select a sample group that reflects this diversity when inviting customers to participate.

8. Follow-up Communication:
- Keeping customers informed about how their feedback is being used can encourage further participation. Edward can create a newsletter or blog post series to update customers on the development process and how their input is shaping the new system.


By using a combination of these methods, Edward can effectively involve a diverse range of customers in the development process while ensuring their feedback is representative of the entire customer base. This collaborative approach will likely result in a trading system that resonates well with users and meets their needs.



### **Involving the right stakeholders is essential for the successful development of the new online trading system. Here are some criteria and guidelines Edward can use to build a comprehensive list of stakeholders:**

**Criteria for Stakeholder Inclusion:**

5. Customer Representation:
- Include customers representing different segments of the user base to ensure that their needs and opinions are well-represented.

6. Regulatory and Compliance Stakeholders:

1. Identify Key Groups:
- List out all groups that interact with or are affected by the trading system (e.g., brokers, customers, regulatory bodies, IT teams, etc.).

2. Conduct Stakeholder Mapping:
- Create a visual map to categorize stakeholders based on their influence and level of interest in the project. This can help prioritize engagement efforts.

By following these criteria and guidelines, Edward can effectively build a diverse and knowledgeable group of stakeholders that will contribute valuable insights to the development of the new online trading system. This collaborative approach will enhance the project's success and ensure that different perspectives are considered.
